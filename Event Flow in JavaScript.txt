Event Flow in JavaScript ...

1.Event Bubbling
This is when the event is first registered on the target (or specified element) on
 which the event happened, and then registered outwards to the parent and onwards to the outermost element.

2.Event Capturing
Event capturing is the opposite of event bubbling. The event starts from the outermost ancestor element
 and travels down the DOM tree to the target element.


Note:- By default, browsers use the event bubbling approach. So there is no need to 
add any argument to the event listener. This is the order in which the event handlers
 will run in response to a click on the button:

button
#innerDiv
#outerDiv


3.Event Stop Propagation Method  ...

The Event stopPropagation() Method
You've learned about how the event bubbling registers an event on an element and 
continues registering the event all the way to the outermost ancestor 
element. You've also seen how event capturing does the opposite.

But what if you don't want the event to register on all the ancestors?
 That's where the stopPropagation method comes in. You can use this method to prevent 
the event from propagating through the whole DOM.
