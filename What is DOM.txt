What is DOM  ?(The JavaScript DOM Manipulation Handbook   ---> freecodecamp.org website)


Answer:-

DOM stands for Document Object Model. But what does that mean? Let's break it down.

The Document part refers to the webpage you see in the browser. 
Specifically, the HTML Document which handles the structure of the page's content.
 This includes the text, images, links, and other elements that make up the page.

Object means the elements like images, headers, and paragraphs are treated like 
objects. Each object has its properties (like id, class, style) and methods. 
Using these properties and methods, you can manipulate the elements.

The Model in DOM means it's a representation or copy of the HTML document as a
hierarchical tree. This tree includes all the elements. And it captures the
parent-child relationships between them.

The DOM is always identical to the HTML document. Browsers ensure that they are in 
sync. So if something changes in the HTML, the DOM changes too, and vice versa.
