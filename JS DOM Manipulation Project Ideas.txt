JS DOM Manipulation Project Ideas  ...

Here are five JS DOM manipulation project ideas to help you practice and solidify your skills.

1.Toggle Switch
Design a toggle switch that changes its state (on/off) when clicked. 
Update the DOM (for example with a background color) that reflects the current 
state of the toggle switch.

2.Random Color Picker
Create a simple app where users can click a button to generate a random color.
 Include a shape on the screen that gets filled with the chosen color.
 Also display the color code on screen.

3.Countdown Timer
Build a timer that starts from a specified time. The app updates in real time and 
shows the remaining time on the screen.

4.Word Counter
Develop an app that provides an input field or text area for the user to type.
 Display the number of words in real time on the screen as the user types.

5.An Interactive To-Do List
Create an app that allows users to add, delete, or edit tasks. You can have fun 
with this one and add as many advanced features as you want. For example, adding 
features like marking tasks as completed, filtering tasks, or sorting them.

Conclusion
If you've come this far, then you now have a good understanding of JavaScript DOM
 manipulation. With practice, you'll be confident enough to tackle advanced projects 
that require knowledge of these DOM manipulation concepts.

A good foundation of Vanilla JS DOM manipulation concepts will also come in handy
 when picking JavaScript libraries/frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, and 
so on.
